# SQL Query Analysis on Music Store Data

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis performed on a music store database. The database schema represents a fictional music store, containing tables for customers, purchases, tracks, albums, genres, and more. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various SQL queries for analyzing the data within the music store database.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of tables representing different aspects of the music store, including:
- **customer**: Information about the store's customers.
- **invoice**: Details of individual purchases made by customers.
- **track**: Information about each music track available in the store.
- **album**: Details of music albums, including their artists and titles.
- **genre**: Genres of music tracks available in the store.
- **artist**: Information about music artists.

## Analysis
The SQL queries provided in this repository cover a range of analytical tasks, including:
- Determining the total revenue generated by the store.
- Identifying the top-selling tracks and albums.
- Analyzing customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Calculating statistics on sales performance, such as average order value and total number of orders.
- Investigating the popularity of music genres across different countries.

## Files
- **queries.sql**: Contains SQL queries used for data analysis tasks.
